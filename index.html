      <h3>In this somewhat personal and totally not embarrassing site we'll be comparing and contrasting the captains of
         the Star
         Trek Silver Age. Between 1987 and 2005, Brannon Braga and Gene Roddenberry dropped four straight
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1-PNUelPuI" target="_blank">BANGERS</a> on tv audiences.
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVIGhYMwRgs" target="_blank"> Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>,
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XDOgS-PfDM&ab_channel=Ryan%27sEdits" target="_blank">Star Trek: Deep
            Space Nine</a>,
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwZiezIxCVU&ab_channel=Jogwheel" target="_blank">Star Trek:
            Voyager</a>, and
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3igUWWIfUM&ab_channel=KaashifHymabaccus" target="_blank">Star Trek:
            Enterprise</a>.
         The captains are, respectively, <a href="#PICARD">Captain Jean-Luc Picard</a>, <a href="#SISKO">Captain
            Benjamin
            Sisko</a>, <a href="JANEWAY">Captain Katheryn Janeway</a>, and
         <a href="ARCHER">Captain Jonathan Archer</a>. We will be judging the captains based on five basic criteria:
         Command Style, Personal Style,
         Hobbies, Relationships, and
         ✨Miscellaneous✨.

         </h4>
         <h4>Command style:</h4>
         <p>
            Picard commands from a bit of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mslbIQF582A"
               target="_blank">distance</a> He clearly cares about his crew, but he doesn't form particularly personal
            relationships, aside from with Dr Beverly Crusher
            (put i a page jump link). He starts out pretty stern, but
            quickly
            warms. He has a self-assuridness that inspires confidence, rather than giving off arrogant vibes. And the
            few
            times
            he’s caught off guard he’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiKwAS1qaCk">deeply charming</a>.
         </p>
         <h4>Personal style:</h4> <img

            width="150" height="150" alt="Picard looking like a snack, 
      and also annoyed">
         <p>Picard loves a flowy blouse and jodhpurs, reflecting his <a href="#HOBBIES">archeological</a> background.
            And
            also like,
            these jammies, pictured above. Which slapp harder than any future bro pj’s deserve to. Overall I'd
            categorize
            his
            style as “boho-chic”. You know there's a lot of bamboo silk and fine, clingy linen. He knows what he's got
            and
            how to
            <a href="https://www.avclub.com/captain-s-holiday-celebrate-picard-day-with-a-look-at-1844034252">work</a>
            it.

         <p>Archeology- he's quite accomplished, and could have easily made a <a
               href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIRQF8PPvUU target="_blank">career anad name for himself</a>. Is
            archeology complicated, from a historical erasure/profiteering standpoint? Yes. Can we
            assume that Picard, and in general the archeological community of the future have worked to be ethical in
            their studies,
            yeah. Is his love for archeology a weakness that leads him to have adventures with a smokin' hot black
            market baddie? Also yeah.
